          <h2>Hi, my name is Irina</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Thank you for visiting my website and your interest in learning a bit more about me. I currently live in Utah with my husband, and enjoy hiking and outdoors. I absolutely love photography and most importantly the happiness it brings to other people. Besides that I do web design and development, and I created this website all on my own. I love everything art and design related: sewing, decorating my house, putting together outfits. I love spending time with my friends and watching "Bachelor" on Tuesday nights with my girlfriends. I love meeting people and learning about them, everyone has a story to tell! I'd like to hear yours and capture it in photographs for generations to come.</p>
